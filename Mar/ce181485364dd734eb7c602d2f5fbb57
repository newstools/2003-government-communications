17 March 2003The Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) in conjunction with the Film Resource Unit, Provincial government s in the North West and Gauteng, as well as the Moretele and Emfuleni Municipalities, will celebrate Human Rights Day with an audiovisual event at two Multi-purpose Community Centres (MPCCs).The first is on 20 March 2003 at the Sebokeng Multi-Purpose Community Centre (MPCC), and the second at the Lebotlwane MPCC on Human Rights Day, 21 March 2003. Seven community workshops during the rest of Human Rights month (March) will also use film and video to convey information and awareness to communities.Given that the handover of the final report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to the President will take place on Human Rights Day, the workshops will also showcase films which document aspects of the work of the TRC. Some of the films that will be screened to the communities include Cry, the Beloved Country; Robert Sobukwe, Fools and Mandela s Unbanning and Release.Through these workshops at MPCCs the organisers aim to investigate innovative communication methods including audio-visual and mobile methods, aimed at helping improve grassroots communication and thereby educating people about their rights and responsibilities in a democracy.Schools in the vicinity of the MPCCs will also benefit from the programme as the organisers will also be running a Mobile Video Education Project in conjunction with the schools.For more information, please contact Fana Baganeng on 012 314 2213 or Desmond Mthembu at FRU on 082 791 7792.The programme is available under the News and events section.Issued by: Government Communications (GCIS)
